# leaflet-challenge

# Project Overview 
In this project, I was tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data to allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations on issues facing our planet. 
I created an earthquake visualization using leaflet, Javascipt and HTML showcasing the earthquakes in various areas on the planet. Each is labeled with the magnitude, location and depth. In addition, I added layer controls so you can toggle different views, as well as view tectonic plate locations. 

## Instructions to Final Work 
You can generate the map using the go live on the "index.html" file. My code/logic can be found in the "logic.js" file. 
These can all be found in the "Starter_Code_2" folder. 
I used the XPert AI Assistance for help with script generation. I did not work with anyone else on the project.

Thank you!
